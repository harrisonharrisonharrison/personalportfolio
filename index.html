          <p>helloooo im harrison, a second year compsci major at uci, and this is my personal website/portfolio. here, i hope to add a project showcase and create a gallery for my photos, among other things.

in my free time, i like to lift, play video games, loredrop, play guitar, and listen to music. i like all genres of music, but my favorites are rnb, prog rock, and rap. i've linked my favorite artist on each genre, but you can check out my spotify here.

i've been lifting since september 2024, and you can usually spot me at the arc. i weigh 140, my bench pr is 205, and i skip
legs.

i really like meeting new people, so feel free to talk to me on any of the socials on the top right. i've also been getting more involved with clubs on campus, like FUSION, Design@UCI, and AI@UCI.</p>
